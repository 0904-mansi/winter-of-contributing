## Introduction
The problem of the design of an ideal, fully-functional information system involves the consideration of the key, indispensable concepts of **security**, **usability**, and **functionality**, which end up governing the system's overall efficiancy and utilitarianism.

### Security
The industry witnesses the inculcation of computer & infomation security into the system design, primarily as the implementation of the key factors of **confidentiality** (ability of a system to prevent unauthorized access to information), **integrity** (systems' ability to protect information to be altered without proper authorization), and **availability** (accessibility to systems to authorized personnel as per requirement).

The concepts of *authentication*—the verification of user identity using some combination of something that one knows (such as a password), something that one has (such as a hardware token, mobile OTP), and something that one is (such as a biometrics)—is often thought of as an additional essential security capability, <br>as well as *reliability*—system's ability to perform and maintain its functions even in hostile circumstances, including but not limited to threats from adversaries, often require to serve hand-in-hand with general system security.


### Usability
Usability of the system broadly encompasses its ability to cater to the user expectations and requirements. It often finds itself represented as a challenge of designing a quality system interface, while at the same time, deals with the inculcation of the concepts of system efficiency, memorability as well as reliability in the form of the its ability to maintain a low error-density.


### Functionality
The principle of functionality entails the ability of the system features to operate and work in their designated manner and thereby deliver the expected performance.

The real challenge lies in striking a balance amongst the degrees to which the system is capable of catering to the satisfaction of these principles of security, usability and functionality, through their implementation in its features.

## The Triangular Trade-off
Despite several technological as well as design advances, harmonious realization of security and usability simulataneously as a part of the system continues to raise conflicts in reaching perfection.

This form of a disputing yet interdependent relationship is well highlighted by the representation of the these concepts as the vertices of a triangle. An attempt of proritising one of these three principles causes the other two to often take the back seat, thus disturbing the equilibrium within the system.

For instance, the employment of ***multi-factor authentication***—a method of user identity verification, whereby they are required to provide two or more pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism to be granted access, for example entering a one-tie-password (OTP) in addition to typing in your account password— can serve as a fortifying asset of the system's ability to implement all the necessary limbs of information security, but at the same time, the additional steps entailed in the process of supplying multiple pieces of identification, can often subdue the system's ease of use with the inevitably added complexity in accessing it. 
Another instance supporting the skewed reationship between the preservation of security, but this time the sacrifice of functionality, is the adoption of the mechanism of **blocking user accounts upon multiple failed login attempts**, popularly known to be associated with Apple devices. While this technique protects the user against potential brute-force attacks and attempts of forced intrusion, often due to the lack of accessible restoration methods, the user might get locked out of their own device, simply from failing to provide the correct authentication details, say, after three attempts. While this hampers the functionality of the device, it negatively impacts the usability too.

On the other end of the spectrum, **prioritising usability through the relaxation in the employed system security measures** in the name of enhancement of user accessibility through "easier" authentication and thus reduced complexity, the system ends up putting the data, identity and privacy of the user at risk to possible unwanted system break-ins and data breaches, while at the same time potentially endangering the functionality of the sytem in case of its compromisation during a malicious attack in the future.

## Conclusion: Balancing Requirements

While seeking to establish perfect equillibrium amongst functionality, usability and security in system design is impractical, no functional information system can acheive a 100% of all the three aspects simultaneously.
Respecting the interdependability of these principles through the design of satisfiably secure policies and applications enabling minimal interference with the usability and the promised functionalities of the system should be adopted as the primary objective by the security professionals and system engineers, to enable the development of a system design close to the ideal.
However, due to the inevitable trade-off between security, usability and functionality, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the system's as well as its users' needs to be able to ultimately settle on an acceptable compromise amongst the three.
