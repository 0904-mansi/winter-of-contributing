## Here is a list of some great open source events.
## Hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest is a really popular open-source program that
is hosted by Digital Ocean and is open to everyone across the world.
Here, you need to submit four or more quality pull requests and you’ll either
get a chance to plant a tree or get a limited-edition t-shirt. There is no such selection criteria.
So, this is very useful for individuals, in particular, who are just starting out with open source. 
You can contribute to participating projects on GitHub and even if you’re not able to make a large major contribution what you
can get out of it is how to use Git and Github.
