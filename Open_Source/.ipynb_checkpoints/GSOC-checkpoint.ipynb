    "\n",
    "The Google Summer of Code, often abbreviated to GSoC, is an international annual program in which Google awards stipends to students who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. It is held annually in the summer months of a year, where students who are above the age of eighteen and enrolled in a university are supposed to complete a software coding project. Students partner with mentors to gain exposure into real world software development.\n",

    "## Eligibility\n",

You will build your network, interact with some of the most extraordinary people in the field. Hey, if you have done fantastic requirements, might be offered a job or invited for an internship by the members of your community or offered a chance to present your work at a conference if this hasnâ€™t convinced you you will be earning a stipend from Google. The amount of compensation depends on the country of your origin.\n",
