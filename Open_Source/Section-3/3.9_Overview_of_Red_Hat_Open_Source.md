# Red Hat Open Source
Red Hat, Inc. is an American IBM subsidiary software company that provides open source software products to enterprises. Founded in 1993, Red Hat has its corporate headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, with other offices worldwide.

<br>

## What is open source?
Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.
<br>
Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer review and community production. Open source software is often cheaper, more flexible, and has more longevity than its proprietary peers because it is developed by communities rather than a single author or company.

<br>

## Why Red Hat for open source? 
Red Hat is the largest open source company in the world. We build and support open source products from open source projects. We give back to the projects and communities we engage in. We defend open source licenses. With open source, we equip our customers for success. We take community-built code and harden its security, add features, and make it enterprise-ready and scalable. Then we push these improvements back out to the original project to benefit the community as a whole.

<br>

## ABOUT RED HAT RESEARCH:
Red Hat Research connects Red Hat engineers with professors, researchers, and students to bring great research ideas into open source communities. Our activities around the world have produced grants from government and industry, papers at top conferences, and results that have landed in open source projects of all kinds. Red Hat Research welcomes participation from research-minded individuals around the world. 

<br>
