# Data Structures and Algorithms


Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ [GirlScript Winter of Contributing](https://gwoc.girlscript.tech/) is a three-month newly established initiative by GirlScript Foundation to be conducted during winters. GWOC encourages individuals to share their knowledge and ideas to develop technical skills and gain valuable experience in the field of tech education. Over the course of the program, participants can contribute to a variety of themes under the guidance of an expert facilitator.

This is the DSA branch for contribution under Girlscript Winter Of Contributing. All the GWOC Contributors and Mentors are welcome!

## Introduction
Data Structure can be defined as the group of data elements which provides an efficient way of storing and organising data in the computer so that it can be used efficiently. Data Structures are widely used in almost every aspect of Computer Science i.e. Operating System, Compiler Design, Artifical intelligence, Graphics and many more.

Data Structures are the main part of many computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way. It plays a vital role in enhancing the performance of a software or a program as the main function of the software is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible.
